# Water_Level_Indicator_using_8051_Microcontroller

This was a group project where I mainly worked with hardware like making the circuit using the components required and finally we developed a water level indicator which indicate the water level (Vacant, Low, Half and Full) in a tank. We used C programming language, MikroC PRO and Progisp Software (for burning code) for the implementation.
